<p>Upload files to S3.</p>
<p>
<b>sourcePath</b> is recommended. By default, they will be uploaded to "${bucket}/${project}/${ref}/${path}/".
Each component of the path can be controlled via the options shown above, or the entire path can be
provided with the fullRemotePath option.
</p>

<p>Basic example usage:</p>
<pre>
// In the github.com/docker/docker.git project with git SHA = deadbeef:
s3Archive("bundles/")
</pre>
<p>This will put the contents of the bundles directory at s3://docker-ci-artifacts/docker/docker/deadbeef/</p>
